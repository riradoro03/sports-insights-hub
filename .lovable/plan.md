### Ricardo Dominguez | Personal Brand Website

## 🎨 Design Direction
- **Color palette**: Dark backgrounds (charcoal/near-black) with energetic accent colors — electric green and vibrant red/orange for highlights, with white text for contrast
- **Typography**: 2 Google Fonts — a bold condensed font for headings (sporty/impactful) and a clean sans-serif for body text
- **Overall feel**: High-energy, athletic, modern — think sports media meets personal brand
- **Your logo** will be placed in the navigation bar and footer
